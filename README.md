# A Simple Token Swap DApp using the 0x Swap API
This project is deployed at: https://ape-x-swap-dapp.vercel.app/ 

This dapp aggregates liquidity across the greater Decentralized exchange ecosystem using 0x to surface the best price to the user and allow them to easily make the trade.

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built using vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, that allows users to swap ERC20 tokens using the 0x API. The DApp provides a simple, intuitive user interface that enables users to easily enter the tokens they wish to swap and the desired trade amount, as well as view relevant pricing information and transaction details.

The DApp leverages the power of the 0x API to execute trades on the Ethereum blockchain in a fast and efficient manner, while also ensuring that transactions are secure and transparent. With this DApp, users can easily swap ERC20 tokens without needing to worry about the complexities of the underlying blockchain technology.

Overall, this DApp is a powerful tool for anyone looking to engage in decentralized trading of ERC20 tokens, and demonstrates the potential of vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for building decentralized applications.
